Quantities are for one complete kit: one follower arm and one leader arm.
Printed parts are listed separately in [printing.md](printing.md).

## Estimated kit cost

**One leader + one follower: $342.4 in components, or $388.4 including printing material.**

| Category | Cost of quantities used (USD) | Buy full packs / spools (USD) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Servos (12 pcs) | $240.7 | $240.7 |
| Electronics, camera and power supplies | $50.5 | $50.5 |
| Bearings, steel guide rods and table clamps | $40.0 | $52.0 |
| Fasteners | $11.2 | $28.6 |
| **Components subtotal** | **$342.4** | **$371.8** |
| Printing material: 0.4 kg PET-CF17 + 0.3 kg PETG-CF + 0.5 kg PLA+ | $46.0 | $58.0 |
| **Total with printing material** | **$388.4** | **$429.8** |

The **Total (USD)** column is the cost of the quantity needed for one kit,
using the reference offer behind each existing line total (not the sum of supplier offers).
Included screws cost $0; alternative carbon tubes are excluded from totals.
Estimates use the reference prices listed below, with each line rounded to cents.
They are not new supplier quotes: confirm the selected variants, minimum order
quantities and prices before ordering. Shipping, taxes, tools, a computer, a printer,
electricity and assembly labour are excluded.

The full-pack column includes unused spares: 0.5 kg spool of PET-CF17, 1.0 kg spools of PETG-CF and PLA+. Printing quantities are budget allowances; re-slice the supplied
3MF projects for your settings. Rod costs use steel; carbon tubes are an alternative.

## Fasteners

Kit totals as packed in the assembly booklet.

Use a removable threadlocker compatible with the printed plastic, e.g. [Vibra-Tite VC-3](https://www.vibra-tite.com/faq/if-vc-3-has-mek-how-can-it-be-plastic-compatible/). Apply VC-3 to metal screw threads and let it dry fully before assembly (at least 30 minutes per its [technical data sheet](https://www.vibra-tite.com/wp-content/uploads/213_tds.pdf)); do not apply it wet to plastic. Confirm compatibility with your filament on a spare print first.
